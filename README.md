DataStructures.Tree
===================

A JavaScript data structure library containing classes for representing tree structures.  

A primary purpose of this library is the ability to be able to convert from a flat self-referencing table to a hierarchical tree, which in turn can be decorated.

The illustrating example shows a flat table representing the code in the DataStructures library being converted to hierarchical json and decorated in a way that is suitable for d3 circle packing.
